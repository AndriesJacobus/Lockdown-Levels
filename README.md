## Minimal Viable Product
The Ivy Team will be developing this app using the Agile methodology, which means we will be phasing development into scoped iterations, starting with the minimum functional requirements needed for the project to deliver value.

Once the MVP Phase one is complete and deployed, we will build the feature list and expand the scope of the project by adding new features while still maintaining the integrity and usefulness of those previously developed.

---

## MVP Phase One Feature List

* See the lockdown alert level of the country as a whole
* See the lockdown alert level certain provinces
* See the lockdown alert level certain metropolitans
* See the regulations, restrictions, and general information about the current lockdown level
* Receive automatic updates as the above information changes

## Future Developments
Future developments may include:

* Getting updates via trusted social media feeds
* Getting push notifications regarding alert level information  
  (like upcoming elevation / alleviation of the current alert status / level, the effective change of the alert level, etc)
* Map view of each province with level indicator
* Heat map of South African provinces according to active coronavirus cases / confirmed cases / number of deceased
